		<h3>Obtaining a Google Maps API Key</h3>
		<p><strong>Please Note</strong>
		You will want to get a free Google Maps API key, so that the Locations plugin can use their geocoder to convert the addresses of your locations into Latitude and Longitude coordinates. You can get an API key from Google for free at <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key" title="Google Maps API Key">this</a> URL.</p>
		<p>Once you have the API key, you should update the Locations plugin's settings to include it.</p>
